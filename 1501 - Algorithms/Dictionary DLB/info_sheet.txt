Additional comments to the grader:
There are no errors, but generating good passwords takes pretty long (4 - 5 minutes) due to the recursive approach I took. 
It still works, however. Additionally, I did not have time to implement the 10 suggestions when a user enters a password not found 
in all_passwords.txt. However, it still suggests 10 passwords when they enter a password of an invalid format.
